/**
 * Shared semantic-release config for the workspace's published npm libraries:
 * newspack-scripts, newspack-components, newspack-colors, newspack-icons.
 *
 * Mirrors config/release.js (used by the plugins) but without a PHP version
 * file — a library's version lives only in package.json. @semantic-release/git
 * commits the bumped package.json (and CHANGELOG.md) back so the in-repo
 * manifest tracks the published version. Without it the manifest stays frozen
 * while the npm/git-tag version advances, which is how newspack-scripts drifted
 * to 5.8.0 in-repo while publishing 5.9.x before the monorepo.
 *
 * Note: multi-semantic-release namespaces tags as `<pkgName>@<version>` and
 * ignores any tagFormat here.
