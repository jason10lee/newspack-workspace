# AI Agent Instructions

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents working with code in this repository. It is the single source of truth for shared conventions across all Newspack repos. Tool-specific files (`CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, etc.) reference this file.

## Overview

newspack-workspace is the Newspack monorepo. It contains all product plugins, themes, and shared packages in a single repository, plus a Docker-based local development environment with containerized PHP/Apache/MySQL.

**This is a pnpm workspace.** Plugins live in `plugins/`, themes in `themes/`, shared packages (newspack-scripts, newspack-components, newspack-colors, newspack-icons) in `packages/`. All workspace packages share a single lockfile and hoisted dependencies.

## Workspace Layout

### Directory Structure

- `plugins/<name>/` - Product plugins (12 total).
- `themes/<name>/` - Themes (newspack-theme, newspack-block-theme).
- `packages/<name>/` - Shared libraries (scripts, components, colors, icons).
- `repos/plugins/<name>/`, `repos/themes/<name>/` - Standalone/local plugin and theme checkouts that live outside the monorepo (e.g. private or customer-specific plugins, `newspack-manager`, licensed WooCommerce extensions). The `repos/plugins` and `repos/themes` directories are tracked (`.gitkeep`); anything you drop inside them is gitignored. Mounted at `/newspack-repos` and symlinked into the active site (`wp-content/plugins/`, `wp-content/themes/`) by `bin/link-repos.sh`. **Any directory works with no registration** - `n` commands (`n build`, `n composer`, `n watch`, cwd-detection) discover `repos/` checkouts by path, so there's no need to edit `bin/repos.sh`. If a name also exists in the monorepo `plugins/`/`themes/`, the **tracked copy wins** and the `repos/` duplicate is skipped. Workflow: drop a real checkout in (clone/unzip directly, or `git worktree add`), build it, then `n restart`/`n start` to pick it up. A symlink *inside* `repos/` pointing outside the workspace will dangle in the container - use a real directory.

Each directory is a standalone WordPress plugin/theme that can be zipped and installed independently.

### Plugins and Themes

The Newspack product consists of these interconnected plugins and themes:

**Core Plugin:**
- `newspack-plugin` - The main Newspack plugin. Provides the setup wizard, reader management, donations, data events API, and integrations with other plugins. Most other plugins depend on utilities from this plugin.

**Content & Publishing:**
- `newspack-blocks` - Custom Gutenberg blocks for news sites (Homepage Posts, Carousel, Author List, etc.)
- `newspack-listings` - Directory and listing functionality for events, places, and marketplaces
- `newspack-sponsors` - Sponsored content management and labeling
- `newspack-story-budget` - Newsroom editorial planning and story budgeting

**Reader Revenue:**
- `newspack-popups` - Campaigns/prompts system for reader engagement (popups, inline prompts, overlays)

**Newsletters:**
- `newspack-newsletters` - Newsletter authoring and sending via ESP integrations (Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, Constant Contact, etc.)

**Advertising:**
- `newspack-ads` - Google Ad Manager integration and ad placement management
- `super-cool-ad-inserter` - Programmatic ad insertion into content

**Multi-site & Network:**
- `newspack-network` - Synchronization system for multi-site Newspack networks (Hub/Node architecture)
- `newspack-multibranded-site` - Support for multiple brands within a single WordPress site

**Manager (SaaS) — not in this monorepo, separate repos:**
- `newspack-manager-admin` - Admin UI on the central hub site (newspack.com); manages and monitors all Newspack sites
- `newspack-manager` - Companion plugin installed on every managed site; reports data back to the hub

**Syndication:**
- `republication-tracker-tool` - Tracks content republication across sites

**Themes:**
- `newspack-theme` - Classic theme and base for style variations
- `newspack-joseph`, `newspack-katharine`, `newspack-nelson`, `newspack-sacha`, `newspack-scott` - Theme variations built on `newspack-theme`
- `newspack-block-theme` - FSE block theme for Newspack sites

### Plugin Relationships

Understanding how plugins interact is crucial for cross-plugin changes:

- **newspack-plugin** is the foundation. It provides:
  - Data Events API (used by newspack-network, newspack-newsletters)
  - Reader data management (used by newspack-popups, newspack-newsletters)
  - Webhooks system (used by newspack-network)
  - Configuration managers for other plugins

- **newspack-popups** uses reader data from newspack-plugin to target campaigns

- **newspack-newsletters** integrates with newspack-popups for subscription prompts

- **newspack-network** uses the Data Events API from newspack-plugin to sync data across sites

- **newspack-blocks** is used across all Newspack sites for content presentation

### Common Patterns Across Repos

**File Structure:**
```
<plugin-name>/
├── <plugin-name>.php      # Main plugin file with header and bootstrap
├── includes/              # PHP classes
│   ├── class-<name>.php   # Main plugin class
│   └── class-*.php        # Feature classes
├── src/                   # JavaScript/React source
├── dist/ or build/        # Compiled assets (gitignored)
├── composer.json          # PHP dependencies
├── package.json           # JS dependencies
└── phpunit.xml            # Test configuration
```

**Naming Conventions:**
- PHP classes: `class-newspack-<feature>.php` with `Newspack_<Feature>` class name
- Hooks: `newspack_<plugin>_<action>` for actions, same for filters
- Options: `newspack_<plugin>_<option_name>`

**Coding Standards:**
- **PHP**: WordPress-Extra, WordPress-Docs, WordPress-VIP-Go standards. Short array syntax `[]` is allowed. Yoda conditions not required.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: ESLint via `newspack-scripts`
- **SCSS**: Stylelint via `newspack-scripts`
- **Formatting**: Prettier — specifically the `wp-prettier` fork (the WordPress house style needs `parenSpacing`, e.g. `( value )`), pinned workspace-wide via a `pnpm` override so editors and CI use the same engine. Canonical config is `newspack-scripts/config/prettier.config.js`. See [docs/code-formatting.md](docs/code-formatting.md) for the editor settings required to keep IDE formatting and CI lint in agreement.
- **Commits**: Conventional commits (`<type>(<scope>): <subject>`) enforced via commitlint. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`. Releases are automated via semantic-release: `feat` triggers a minor release, `fix` triggers a patch release.
- A husky pre-commit hook runs `lint-staged` on every `git commit` (installed via `prepare` on `pnpm install` at the workspace root). It **checks** staged files — JS/TS with ESLint, SCSS with Stylelint, PHP with PHP_CodeSniffer (via `bin/precommit-phpcs.sh` → `vendor/bin/phpcs` against the shared root `phpcs.xml`) — and **blocks the commit on any lint error** (warnings do not block; it does not auto-fix). All staged files use the single root config (`.lintstagedrc.json`, forced via `lint-staged --config`), so behavior is uniform across every package. The PHP check uses the WP coding standards in the workspace-root `vendor/`, provisioned by `n ci-build all` during setup (or run `composer install` once at the workspace root). Run the affected package's `fix:js` / `format:scss` / `fix:php` script (e.g. `pnpm --filter <package> run format:scss`) to auto-fix, or `git commit --no-verify` to bypass. GUI git clients (Tower, GitHub Desktop, IDE integrations) may launch the hook without `pnpm` on PATH and fail with `pnpm: command not found` — commit from the terminal or use `--no-verify` in that case. (Only `.scss` is linted, not plain `.css`.) To run your own personal hooks alongside the lint (husky owns `core.hooksPath`, so a custom one would otherwise be overwritten), put them in `.husky/pre-commit.local` (gitignored, per-clone) — it's run after the lint and exits non-zero to block. Direct pushes to `main` are blocked.
- Reference issue numbers in commits and PR descriptions.
- Do not modify changelog files or `.pot` translation files. These are auto-generated by CI workflows.

## Key Commands

All commands use the `n` script from the repository root. The `n` script is context-aware: it detects your current working directory and targets the appropriate project/container automatically. It works in both interactive terminals and non-interactive contexts (CI, AI agents).

### Container Management
```bash
n start           # Start containers (PHP 8.3)
n start 8.2       # Start with PHP 8.2
n stop            # Stop containers
n restart         # Stop and start
```

### First-Time Setup
```bash
cp default.env .env           # Create local config
./build-image.sh              # Build Docker image (PHP 8.3)
./build-image-82.sh           # Build PHP 8.2 image
n start                       # Launch containers
n install                     # Install WordPress
n ci-build all                # Build all projects
n setup --yes                 # Bootstrap site with content and plugins
```

### Building Projects
```bash
n build                       # Build current project (from within repo folder)
n build newspack-plugin       # Build specific project
n build newsletters           # 'newspack-' prefix can be omitted
n ci-build                    # npm ci + build for current project
n ci-build all                # Build all projects
```

### Testing
```bash
n test-php                          # Run all PHPUnit tests (from within repo folder)
n test-php --group byline-block     # Run tests by group
n test-php --filter test_name       # Run a specific test method
n test-php --list-groups            # List available test groups
n test-js                           # Run JS tests
```

### Development
```bash
n watch <name>                # Watch & rebuild a single project (or run `n watch` from inside its folder)
n watch                       # From the root: watch every plugin/theme/package and rebuild the changed unit
n composer <cmd>              # Run composer in current project
n npm <cmd>                   # Run npm in current project
```

`n watch` with no project (run from the monorepo root) starts a single global
dispatcher that watches source files across `plugins/`, `themes/` and
`packages/`. Webpack watchers are spawned **lazily**: the first time you edit a
unit, that unit's own incremental watcher (`wp-scripts start`) is started and
owns its rebuilds from then on — so only units you actually touch get a watcher,
never all of them at once. Units without a `watch` script fall back to a one-off
`build` when files under their `src/` change; units with neither are skipped.

When you're iterating hard on a single project, prefer `n watch <name>` (or
`n watch` from inside it): the warm webpack watcher rebuilds incrementally in
well under a second, whereas the global watch pays a fresh build the first time
it sees a unit that has no incremental `watch` script.

### WordPress CLI
```bash
n wp <command>                # Run WP-CLI command (--allow-root is added automatically)
```

**Quoting limitation**: `n wp` does not support arguments with spaces (SQL queries, `wp eval` code, etc.) because they get word-split. For these, use `docker exec` directly:
```bash
docker exec newspack_dev sh -c "wp db query 'SELECT * FROM wp_options WHERE option_name=\"siteurl\";' --allow-root"
docker exec newspack_dev sh -c "wp eval 'echo get_option(\"blogname\");' --allow-root"
```
The main container is `newspack_dev`. For isolated environments, the container name is `newspack_env_<name>` where `<name>` matches what was passed to `n env create <name>`, with dashes replaced by underscores (e.g., `n env create my-feature` creates container `newspack_env_my_feature`).

### Multi-Site
```bash
n sites-add <name>            # Create additional site at name.test
n sites-list                  # List additional sites
n sites-drop <name>           # Remove site
```

**Note:** Additional sites run in the same container and share plugin code — use them for multi-site/manager workflows. For branch isolation (different plugin versions), use isolated environments instead (see below).

## Architecture

### Directory Structure
- `plugins/` - Product plugins, mounted at `/newspack-plugins/` in container
- `themes/` - Themes, mounted at `/newspack-themes/` in container
- `packages/` - Shared libraries (scripts, components, colors, icons)
- `html/` - Main WordPress site, mounted at `/var/www/html`
- `additional-sites-html/` - Additional WordPress sites
- `manager-html/` - Newspack Manager site
- `bin/` - Shell scripts mounted at `/var/scripts/` in container
- `config/` - Apache, PHP, MySQL configuration

### Docker Services
- `wordpress` (container: `newspack_dev`) - Apache + PHP + WordPress
- `db` - MariaDB 11.8.6
- `mailhog` - Email capture at http://localhost:8025
- `adminer` - Database UI at http://localhost:8088

### Context-Aware Commands
The `n` script detects your current working directory:
- From `plugins/<project>/` or `themes/<project>/` - commands target that project
- From `additional-sites-html/<site>/` - commands target that site
- From `manager-html/` - commands target the manager site
- Otherwise - commands target the main site

Use `ncd <name>` (install with `n cd-install`) for quick navigation between projects.

### Caching
- Memcached enabled via `html/wp-content/object-cache.php`
- Batcache for page caching via `advanced-cache.php`

### Xdebug
Configured on port 9003 with IDE key `DOCKERDEBUG`. Path mapping: `/newspack-plugins/<project>` maps to local `plugins/<project>`, `/newspack-themes/<project>` maps to local `themes/<project>`.

## Isolated Environments for Parallel Development

Each isolated environment gets its own Docker container, WordPress installation, and database — completely independent of the main site. This enables parallel development and testing without interference.

### Quick Start
```bash
n env create myenv --worktree newspack-plugin:mybranch
n env up myenv
n setup --env myenv --yes     # fully configured Newspack site
# → https://myenv.test/  (override with --domain)
```

### Environment Commands
```bash
n env create <name> [options]  # Create environment config
  --worktree <repo>:<branch>   #   Mount a worktree (repeatable for multiple repos)
  --domain <domain>            #   Custom domain (default: <name>.test)
  --up                         #   Start the environment immediately after creation
n env up <name> [--build]      # Start environment (creates DB, installs WP, sets up SSL)
n env up --all [--build]       # Start all existing environments at once
n env down <name>              # Stop environment
n env destroy <name>           # Remove environment, DB, worktrees, and files
n env list                     # List environments with status, URLs, and worktrees
n env list --porcelain         # Machine-readable tab-separated output (name, status, url, worktrees)
n env cleanup                  # Interactive bulk cleanup of environments
```

### Site Setup
```bash
n setup [options]              # Bootstrap current site with full Newspack config
n setup --env <name> [options] # Bootstrap an isolated environment
  --yes                        #   Skip confirmation (destructive: resets DB)
  --url <url>                  #   Override site URL (default: auto-detect)
  --block-theme                #   Use newspack-block-theme instead of newspack-theme
  --woocommerce                #   Enable WooCommerce + donations + subscriptions (off by default)
  --campaigns                  #   Enable campaign/prompt setup (off by default)
  --no-posts                   #   Skip post/category creation
  --posts-count N              #   Number of posts (default: 10)
  --customers-count N          #   Number of WooCommerce customers (default: 10)
```

Run `n setup --help` for all available options.

`n setup` resets the database and creates a site with: theme, Newspack plugins, posts with categories, homepage, users, and menus. Use `--woocommerce` to add donations/memberships/subscriptions, and `--campaigns` for prompts.

### Shell Access
```bash
n sh                           # Shell into main container
n sh <name>                    # Shell into environment container
```

### How It Works
- Each env binds to a unique loopback IP (127.0.0.2+) on ports 80/443 with HTTPS via mkcert
- Domain defaults to the loopback IP, overridable with `--domain`
- `n start` pre-creates loopback aliases (127.0.0.2–100) so agents can create envs without sudo. If `newspack-manage-host` is installed (via `./bin/setup-networking.sh`), networking is set up without password prompts -- otherwise `sudo` is required
- Each env mounts `envs/<name>/html/` as `/var/www/html` (isolated from `./html/`)
- Each env gets its own database (`wordpress_<name>`) in the shared MariaDB server
- Each env gets a unique `WP_CACHE_KEY_SALT` to prevent memcached key collisions
- Worktrees override specific plugins (e.g., `newspack-plugin`) while sharing the rest from `./plugins/`
- All env containers join a shared `newspack_envs` Docker bridge network with their domain as a DNS alias, enabling inter-container communication (e.g., hub/node setups)
- `n env destroy` cleans up everything: container, DB, html dir, hosts entry, and worktrees

### Claude Code Plugin Skills

If the `newspack` Claude Code plugin is installed, these skills wrap the commands above:
- `newspack:worktree` — Create or remove git worktrees for branch isolation
- `newspack:env-create` — Create worktrees + isolated Docker environment with HTTPS domain
- `newspack:env-destroy` — Destroy environment and clean up worktrees

## Cross-Plugin Workflow

When making changes that span multiple plugins:

### 1. Understand the Change Scope
Before making changes, identify which plugins are affected:
- Check for hooks/filters that connect plugins (grep for `do_action`, `apply_filters`, `add_action`, `add_filter`)
- Look for direct function calls between plugins
- Check if changing an API that other plugins consume

### 2. Make Changes in Dependency Order
If Plugin A depends on Plugin B:
1. Make changes to Plugin B first
2. Build Plugin B: `n build <plugin-b>`
3. Test Plugin B in isolation
4. Make changes to Plugin A
5. Build and test Plugin A

### 3. Testing Cross-Plugin Changes
```bash
# Rebuild affected plugins
n build newspack-plugin
n build newspack-popups

# Run PHP tests for each
cd plugins/newspack-plugin && n test-php
cd plugins/newspack-popups && n test-php
```

### 4. Git Workflow for Multi-Repo Changes
Everything is in a single repository. Cross-plugin changes happen in one branch and one PR.

### 5. Finding Code Across Plugins
```bash
# Search all plugins for a hook
grep -r "newspack_reader_logged_in" plugins/

# Find where a function is defined
grep -rn "function get_reader_data" plugins/

# Find all usages of a class
grep -rn "Newspack_Popups" plugins/
```

## Common Integration Points

### Data Events API (newspack-plugin)
Used for async event processing:
```php
// Registering an event handler
Newspack\Data_Events::register_handler('reader_logged_in', 'my_handler');

// Dispatching an event
Newspack\Data_Events::dispatch('reader_logged_in', $data);
```

### Reader Data (newspack-plugin)
Central reader/user management:
```php
// Get current reader
$reader = Newspack\Reader_Activation::get_current_reader();

// Check reader status
Newspack\Reader_Activation::is_reader_logged_in();
```

### Webhooks (newspack-plugin)
For external integrations:
```php
Newspack\Webhooks::send('endpoint_id', $payload);
```

### Configuration Managers
newspack-plugin provides configuration managers for other plugins:
- `Newspack_Popups_Configuration_Manager`
- `Newspack_Ads_Configuration_Manager`
- `Newspack_Theme_Configuration_Manager`

## Git & Commit Rules

- **Merge strategy**: Always use **squash merge** (`gh pr merge --squash`) when merging PRs. The only exceptions are branch promotions (`main` to `alpha`, `alpha` to `release`, `release` to `main`, `release` to `alpha`), which use merge commits to preserve history.
- **Commit messages**: Subject must be a single line, max 72 characters, in conventional commit format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`. No body. `Co-Authored-By` trailers are required after a blank line.
- **Never push automatically**. Always ask for confirmation before pushing to remote.

## Claude Code Plugin

The `newspack` plugin provides Newspack-specific skills for PR workflows and development tasks. See the [newspack-devkit README](https://github.com/Automattic/newspack-devkit) for the full list of available skills.

If the plugin is not installed, run `n setup-agents` to install all recommended plugins, or add it manually:

```
/plugin marketplace add Automattic/newspack-devkit
/plugin install newspack@newspack-devkit
```

## Pull Requests

Use the `newspack` plugin skills for the full PR lifecycle:
1. `newspack:pr-create` — Create draft PR and request Copilot review
2. `newspack:pr-feedback` — Address review comments and resolve threads
3. `newspack:pr-ready` — Mark ready for human review and apply label
4. `newspack:pr-merge` — Merge after approval and checks pass
5. `newspack:pr-test` — Test a PR in an isolated environment with automated checks and code review

## External Tools

- **Linear**: Use MCP tools for Linear operations when available. Write operations (creating or updating issues, comments, etc.) require explicit user confirmation.
- **GitHub**: Always use `gh` CLI for GitHub operations (PRs, issues, checks, releases, etc.).
