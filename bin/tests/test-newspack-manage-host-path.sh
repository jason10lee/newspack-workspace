#
# Spec for the pinned PATH in bin/newspack-manage-host.
#
# That wrapper is granted passwordless root by a sudoers drop-in, and macOS
# sudoers sets no secure_path, so sudo passes the caller's PATH straight
# through. A helper binary placed earlier in that PATH would therefore run as
# root. The wrapper pins PATH to root-owned system directories to prevent it;
# this spec proves the pin is not overridable by the caller.
#
# Nothing here needs privileges and nothing mutates host state. The probe calls
# alias-add with 127.0.0.999, which the wrapper's own validation accepts
# (^127\.0\.0\.[0-9]+$) and ifconfig rejects as a bad value, so the helper call
# is reached but never applied. That holds under root too, which matters
# because CI containers commonly run as one.
#
# Two properties are read from the wrapper rather than restated here, because a
# copy in this file would go stale in the direction that matters: widening the
# pin, or adding a helper it does not cover, would still be checked against
# yesterday's values and pass.
