# Self-proving spec for bin/constants-scanner.php and the scanner class it
# wraps, bin/class-newspack-constants-scanner.php.
#
# The scanner and its fixtures moved here from newspack-manager-admin, where
# they were covered by a PHPUnit suite (WordPress test scaffolding this
# monorepo's root-level scripts have no equivalent of). This spec ports every
# assertion from that suite to the CLI, running it exactly as CI and the
# reusable workflow do: `php bin/constants-scanner.php --source=... --format=json`
# over the fixtures at bin/tests/fixtures/constants/, read back with jq.
#
# Run: bash bin/tests/test-constants-scanner.sh
