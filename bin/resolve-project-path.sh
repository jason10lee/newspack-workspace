# Resolves a project name (e.g. "newspack-plugin") to its container-side
# path. Three possible locations:
#   /newspack-plugins/<name> — monorepo plugins (incl. --worktreed standalone)
#   /newspack-themes/<name>  — monorepo themes
#   /newspack-repos/<name>   — standalone repos that aren't currently --worktreed
#
# Usage:
#   source /var/scripts/resolve-project-path.sh
#   path=$(resolve_project_path "newspack-plugin")
