# lib.sh — shared helpers for the legacy → monorepo migration scripts.
#
# Sourced by sync-legacy.sh (daily trunk sync) and transplant-pr.sh (per-PR
# transplant on cutover day). Provides:
#
#   • The legacy-repo manifest: name → target subdir in the monorepo.
#   • Path-rewrite / merge helpers used to land legacy commits cleanly:
#       - apply_structural_overrides: drop legacy .github/, package-lock.json,
#         and pin workspace:* in plugin/theme package.json.
#       - normalize_package_repos: rewrite repository.url in every workspace
#         package.json so semantic-release resolves to the monorepo, not the
#         standalone legacy repo.
#       - route_extracted_packages: relocate any
#         plugins/newspack-plugin/packages/{colors,components,icons}/* to
#         packages/<pkg>/* (those package homes moved during extraction).
#   • Dry-run wrappers around git push and gh pr create.
#   • Helpers to look up the manifest entry for a given legacy repo name.
#
# The whole bin/migration/ tree is intended to be deleted after cutover —
# none of this code is needed once development has moved to the monorepo.

# Manifest: legacy repo name → monorepo target subdir. Stable order; the
# integrate phase of sync-legacy.sh merges in this order, so changing it
# changes the resulting merge-commit shape on monorepo-integration.
