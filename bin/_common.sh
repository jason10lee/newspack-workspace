# without it `n env create --help` validates cleanly and creates an environment
# called "--help" instead of printing usage. It excludes a leading dash and
# nothing else, deliberately. This validator also gates `up`, `down` and
# `destroy`, so a rule that rejected leading dots or underscores would strand an
# environment created under an older, laxer one — unmanageable and removable
# only by hand.
# Stricter still for a name being created. The leniency in validate_env_name
# exists so environments made under an older, laxer rule stay manageable by
# `up`/`down`/`destroy`, and that reason cannot apply to a name that does not
# exist yet. A leading dot is the case it costs: `.demo` yields
# https://.demo.test, whose first DNS label is empty, and the container name and

# Whether a project's vendor/ was installed with its dev dependencies.
#
# `n env up` provisions vendor/ with --no-dev (see ensure-vendor.sh): enough to
# activate a plugin, but without PHPUnit or the Yoast polyfills the WordPress
# test bootstrap requires. Both kinds of install write vendor/autoload.php, so
# its presence says nothing about whether the tests can run — composer's own
# record of which install produced the directory, installed.json's top-level
# "dev" flag, is what separates them.
#
# Read without a JSON parser: this is sourced on the host, in the containers and
# in CI, and no single parser is present in all three. Two things make the
# plain-text read safe. The value must be a bare boolean alone on its line,
# which skips the `"dev": "Development related task"` entries real packages
# carry in their metadata; and of the lines surviving that, the last is the
# top-level flag, because composer writes it after the packages array closes.
# Leading whitespace is not matched, so re-indenting the file changes nothing.
#
# The two unhappy paths answer differently, on purpose:
#
# - No readable installed.json means nothing was installed here, so the tests
#   cannot run whatever else is true. Report absent and let the caller explain
#   how to fix it.
# - A file that exists but yields no recognisable flag means composer wrote a
#   shape this function does not know — a format change, say. Report present.
#   Guessing "absent" there would block every project at once, with no way past
#   it; reporting present costs only a return to the bootstrap error this guard
#   was added to replace, for whoever hits it first.
