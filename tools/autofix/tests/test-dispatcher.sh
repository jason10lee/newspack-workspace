# issue_postclaim_ok.json's claim comment body is the literal string "RUNID" —
# it will never match the run id the dispatcher actually mints (autofix-<issue>-<date>-<hex>),
# so `run` deterministically loses the claim race here. That's an acceptable path
# for THIS test: ledger init + branch_stem recording happen before the claim call,
# so they're on disk regardless of whether the claim held. The happy claim path
# (comment body matching) is already covered by test-claim.sh — not duplicated here.
# `run`'s claim call is unguarded (propagates exit 4/5 via `set -e`), so on a lost
# race the script dies before printing RUN_ID= — recover the minted id from the
# runs/ directory listing instead of from stdout.

# regression: a corrupt (truncated-JSON) ledger must not abort the pre-flight
# sweep or the same-issue guard — `run` must get past both to the claim attempt
