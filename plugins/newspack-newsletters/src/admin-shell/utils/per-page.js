/**
 * Items-per-page constants shared by the DataView list screens.
 *
 * `PER_PAGE_ALL` is a client-side sentinel: "All" fetches a chunk at a
 * time and concatenates (see `use-collection-data.js`).
 *
 * The two ceilings below are deliberately different. `MAX_SELECTABLE_PER_PAGE`
 * bounds what a user can pick and store; `FETCH_ALL_CHUNK_SIZE` bounds
 * what one request of the "All" walk asks for, and is larger because
 * each round trip costs a full WordPress bootstrap while the rows
 * themselves are cheap. A screen whose rows are not cheap overrides it.
