/**
 * Audience › Registered readers (NPPD-1733).
 *
 * The one Audience section sourced from the local wp_users table rather than
 * GA4. It is the foundational audience population in the funnel
 * (visitors → registered readers → subscribers → donors) and the canonical count
 * behind the GA4 "known reader" segment shown in Composition below — the section
 * description names that relationship so the two numbers don't read as competing.
 *
 * Two cards, both via MetricCard directly (not Scorecard) so the wp_users
 * query-error edge state can use the NPPD-1698 notComputable em-dash + line:
 *   - Total registered readers — all-time snapshot, no period delta. A real 0
 *     (new publisher) renders as an honest 0, not an empty state.
 *   - New registered readers — accounts created in the timeframe, with a period
 *     delta vs the previous equal-length timeframe. The delta is suppressed when
 *     none were created (a "↓100%" against a real prior would misread an honest
 *     zero), mirroring Subscribers' "New subscribers" card.
 *
 * Rendered in both AudienceTab branches: alongside the GA4 sections normally, and
 * directly under the connect banner when GA4 isn't connected (this count doesn't
 * need GA4).
