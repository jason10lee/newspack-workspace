/**
 * FreeReaderConversionSection (NPPD-1604, Section 2; empty states NPPD-1702).
 *
 * Two scorecards side-by-side covering registration-gate conversion
 * (Direct attribution and Influenced 7-day lookback).
 *
 * Mirrors the Paid section's empty-state treatment (NPPD-1694), with one
 * production-safety distinction that is the whole point of NPPD-1702: the count
 * fields this section reads (`registration_impressions_total` /
 * `registrations_total`) come from a hub BigQuery change that may ship AFTER
 * this code. So detection is THREE-way, not two:
 *   - fields ABSENT (hub not deployed) → render exactly today's behavior: the
 *     regwall percentage scorecards, no empty state. Graceful degradation.
 *   - fields present, impressions === 0 → `no_opportunity`
 *   - fields present, impressions > 0 but registrations === 0 → `no_conversions`
 *     (with the impressions count as {N})
 *   - fields present, normal data → the scorecards, each carrying its count
 *     fallback so an individual zero card reads as "0 of N" rather than 0%.
 *
 * An absent field is NOT a zero: a present 0 is a real signal, a missing field
 * is "the hub hasn't shipped." Collapsing the two would silently degrade a
 * working production section — the exact failure this ticket exists to prevent.
