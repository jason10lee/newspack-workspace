/**
 * Flow — add people to a group directly, on the owner's behalf.
 *
 * The admin capability the owner does not have: unlike an invitation, an existing
 * reader is put into the group straight away with no acceptance step.
 *
 * People with no account yet cannot be added directly — there is nobody to add —
 * so they are invited instead, and the result says exactly which happened to whom.
 * That is not a workaround: an invitation is how this system onboards someone who
 * has no reader account, and it is the path that gets their consent rather than
 * minting an account for an address that never asked for one.
