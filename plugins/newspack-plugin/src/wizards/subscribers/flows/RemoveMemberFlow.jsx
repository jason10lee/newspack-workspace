/**
 * Flow — remove one or more people from a group.
 *
 * Removing frees the seat and the person loses the access the group was giving
 * them; it never touches any individual subscription they hold of their own.
 *
 * The server is the authority on who may be removed: the owner can never be, and
 * a manager may not remove a peer manager (Group_Subscription::can_actor_remove_member()).
 * The screen only offers what is permitted; a refusal still surfaces here.
