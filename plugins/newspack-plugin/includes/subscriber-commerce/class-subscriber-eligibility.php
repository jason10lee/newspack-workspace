 *
 * Thin, memoizing wrapper over Access_Rules::has_active_subscription(), which
 * walks the reader's own WooCommerce subscriptions and the group subscriptions
 * they hold a seat in. That lookup is uncached and runs per call, while the
 * callers hit it once per product: a shop archive of N covered products would
 * otherwise repeat the same subscription queries N times for the same reader.
 *
 * Only *held* subscriptions count. A subscription sitting in the reader's cart,
 * or one being purchased in the same order, does not make them a subscriber.
 *
 * Two policies come with the underlying lookup rather than from here, and every
 * caller inherits them: a seat in a group subscription counts, and a subscription
 * on hold inside the payment-recovery window counts by default — so a reader whose
 * renewal is mid-retry keeps their subscriber pricing and access until the retries
 * are exhausted.
