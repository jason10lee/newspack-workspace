	/**
	 * Create or update Newspack Access Control content gates from WooCommerce
	 * Membership plans.
	 *
	 * Plans with identical content restriction rules are grouped and represented by
	 * a single gate whose title is all matching plan names joined with " | ". Plans
	 * with different restrictions each get their own gate.
	 *
	 * For each gate (group of plans):
	 * - Creates a new content gate (or updates an existing one matched by title).
	 * - Sets content rules from the shared restriction rules, other than the ones
	 *   selecting newsletter lists.
	 * - Enables registration settings (always) and custom_access settings (only
	 *   when every plan in the group requires a purchase — a group that also holds a
	 *   signup plan is registration-gated, since either plan grants access in WCM).
	 * - Copies block content from the first plan's np_memberships_gate post (falling
	 *   back to the Primary gate) into the gate's registration / paid-access layouts.
	 *
	 * Newsletter list restrictions are not migrated here. A plan can restrict articles
	 * and newsletter lists at once, and the two halves live in different gate buckets:
	 * this command writes the article half, and `wp newspack
	 * migrate-premium-newsletters` writes the list half. A plan that restricts only
	 * lists is skipped with a row saying so, but a plan that restricts both migrates
	 * here and reports as a plain success, so run both commands on any site whose
	 * plans gate newsletters.
	 *
	 * Dry-run by default; pass --live to write.
	 *
	 * Both modes surface predictable migration issues as WARN rows. Purchase-mode
	 * gaps (no custom_access layout found, no paid access rule to write)
	 * and content-rule slugs the evaluator cannot resolve are computable from the
	 * group data before any write, so they appear in dry-run and make the planning
	 * pass predictive rather than optimistic. A dry run reports every one of them and
	 * still prints its table; --live refuses to start on a group that would publish an
	 * open paid gate, since there the WARN row would arrive after the write.
	 *
	 * On --live each written gate is additionally re-read and checked against the full
	 * set of conditions the frontend evaluator applies; any gate that would not restrict — or would restrict less
	 * than the plan it came from, e.g. a paid plan that migrated to a gate any
	 * registered reader passes — is reported as a WARN row rather than counted as a
	 * plain success. Migrated gates stay dormant until WooCommerce Memberships is
	 * deactivated, so without this an unenforceable gate would look migrated for as
	 * long as it takes someone to notice at cutover.
	 *
	 * Re-running is NOT edit-preserving: an existing gate matched by title has its
	 * content rules and layout content overwritten with freshly extracted markup, so
	 * any customization made in the admin after a previous run is lost. A layout is
	 * left alone when nothing could be extracted for it, so an empty extraction never
	 * blanks a working layout.
	 *
	 * Every decision that needs an operator is settled before the first write: the
	 * groups are scanned, the problems are reported, and the one confirmation prompt
	 * is asked with nothing yet written. Consolidation widens access, a carve-out
	 * rewrites one gate's content rules and moves access products onto another gate,
	 * and an un-mergeable overlap leaves a reader liable to be denied — so all three go
	 * to that prompt: none of them is written on --live without someone answering for
	 * it. Declining exits non-zero, so a cutover that chains the Memberships
	 * deactivation onto this command stops there too. The write loop then runs to
	 * completion unattended, so a run that is interrupted at a prompt is a run that
	 * changed nothing.
	 *
	 * ## OPTIONS
	 *
	 * [--live]
	 * : Apply the changes. Without this flag the command runs as a dry-run and writes nothing.
	 *
	 * [--plan=<id>]
	 * : Only process the plan with this post ID. Useful for testing.
	 *
	 * [--one-time-duration=<duration>]
	 * : How long access lasts after a one-time purchase. Accepts "forever", "<n>days" or "<n>months". Each plan's own access length is read by default, so this is only needed for a plan whose access ends on a fixed calendar date, which is not a duration from the purchase. Applies to every such plan in the run.
	 *
	 * [--yes]
	 * : Answer yes to the pre-flight confirmation prompt, which is shown when gates would be created alongside gates the same plans were migrated to individually, when plan groups are consolidated onto one gate, when one group's content is carved out of another group's gate (the one case that rewrites a gate's content rules and moves access products from one gate to another), or when two gates would be written over overlapping content. Required for non-interactive runs (cron, `ssh host "wp ..."`): with no terminal to answer the prompt, the command errors out rather than exiting silently mid-migration. Declining the prompt exits non-zero.
	 *

	 *
	 * The post_type vs. taxonomy split uses the rule's own `get_content_type()`

	 * Migrate a site's WooCommerce Memberships RSS feed configuration into the

	 *
	 * Access Control governs feeds from its own `restrict_feeds` /
	 * `feed_restriction_mode` options, which the gate migration does not set — so
	 * without this a migrated site falls back to the shipped defaults regardless of
	 * how its feeds behaved under Memberships. The mapping:
	 *
	 * - "Skip content restriction in RSS feeds" on → feeds were unrestricted →
	 *   restrict_feeds off.
	 * - Restriction mode "Hide content only" (hide_content) → item kept with a
	 *   teaser → feed_restriction_mode truncate.
	 * - Restriction mode "Hide completely" / "Redirect" (hide/redirect) → item
	 *   dropped from the feed → feed_restriction_mode exclude.
	 *
	 * Best run before Memberships is deactivated, while its options are still the
	 * live feed policy. Access Control yields feeds to Memberships until cutover,
	 * so the written values take effect only once Memberships is deactivated. It
	 * also runs on an already-flipped site: WCM's options outlive the plugin, so
	 * the pre-flip policy is still recoverable, and those sites are the ones now
	 * running defaults nobody chose.
	 *
	 * Nothing is written on a site that already has Access Control feed settings of
	 * its own — a stored value is a decision, and only the absent case is a default
	 * worth correcting. Such a site is reported and skipped.
	 *
	 * The mapping reads options only. A site whose feeds are governed at runtime by
	 * a `wc_memberships_is_feed_restricted` filter (Google Extended Access, PugPig)
	 * is not reflected in the stored mode — verify those sites before cutover.
	 *
	 * Dry-run by default; pass --live to write.
	 *
	 * ## OPTIONS
