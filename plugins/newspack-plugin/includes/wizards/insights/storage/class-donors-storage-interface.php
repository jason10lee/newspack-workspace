/**
 * Newspack Insights — Donors Storage Interface (NPPD-1617).
 *
 * Contract for the per-backend Tab 7 (Donors) data layer. Mirrors the
 * Tab 6 {@see Storage_Interface} pattern: two implementations (HPOS,
 * legacy CPT) dispatch via {@see Storage_Detector::detect()}. The
 * shared {@see Donation_Product_Classifier} provides the donation
 * product ID set — Tab 7 uses it with `IN` filters where Tab 6 uses
 * `NOT IN`.
 *
 * SQL bodies reference `~/Sites/insights-docs/formulas/tab-7-donors.md`
 * and the cross-cutting schema reference at
 * `~/Sites/insights-docs/formulas/subscription-donation-schema.md`.
 * The 11 methods below cover the user-spec metric list for Tab 7 v1
 * (ARR and Total revenue are derived in the orchestrator, not here).
 *
 * Per-query join surface (per the schema doc's verified
 * shop_order-only behavior of `wc_order_product_lookup`):
 *
 *   - Shop_order-scoped queries (one-time + renewal revenue, new
 *     donors, average gift) use `{prefix}wc_order_product_lookup`.
 *   - Shop_subscription-scoped queries (active recurring donors,
 *     donation MRR, lapsed donors, recurring retention) use
 *     `{prefix}woocommerce_order_items` +
 *     `{prefix}woocommerce_order_itemmeta._product_id`.
 *
 * The Active Donors UNION metric crosses both surfaces and
 * deduplicates by `customer_id`.
