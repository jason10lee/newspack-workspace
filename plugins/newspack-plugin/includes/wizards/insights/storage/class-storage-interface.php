 * legacy CPT (`wp_posts` / `wp_postmeta`). Dispatch chosen per-publisher
 * by {@see Storage_Detector::detect()}.
 *
 * SQL bodies live in
 * `~/Sites/insights-docs/formulas/tab-6-subscribers.md` and the
 * cross-cutting reference at
 * `~/Sites/insights-docs/formulas/subscription-donation-schema.md`.
 * Those docs are the authoritative source for query shape; this
 * interface only fixes the PHP boundary.
 *
 * Donation product IDs are injected at construction so the metric
 * methods stay free of the donation set parameter — see
 * {@see Donation_Product_Classifier::get_donation_product_ids()}.
