<?php
/**
 * Characterization tests for the migrate-membership-gates CLI (NPPD-2059).
 *
 * These pin the behavior of the pure mapping/fingerprint/layout-extraction
 * helpers. The map_rules_to_ac_format tests assert the NPPD-2063 translation table
 * (WC content rules → valid AC 'post_types' / 'specific_posts' / taxonomy slugs).
 * The extract_gate_layouts / serialize_gate_inner_blocks tests assert the NPPD-2058
 * behavior: a gate layout is found wherever the wrapper block sits, including nested
 * and reusable blocks, and membership wrappers nested in the result are stripped.
 *
 * NPPD-2064 (content-overlap consolidation) is pinned by the tests below: the decision
 * through its pure helpers — rules_cover, rule_sets_overlap, plan_rule_set_consolidation —
 * and the fold itself through consolidate_plan_groups(), which is what writes the merged
 * group the gate is built from. Only group_plans_by_fingerprint() ahead of it needs
 * WC_Memberships_Membership_Plan and is exercised end-to-end instead. The
 * compute_rules_fingerprint() tests pin the fingerprint's canonicality, which that fix
 * preserves.
